## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(1)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

input
{8,4,23,42,16,15}
output
[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
big o :
time : big O(n log(n))
space:big O(n)
