# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
i used {200}->{284}->{364}->{24}->NULL

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Create a Linked List class

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
insert method: time O(n) , space O(n)
includes method: time O(n) , spaceO(n)
toString method: time O(n) , spaceO(n)



## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

* Insert Method : enter an integer value inside this function and added it to the first of the linked list

* Include Method : enter an integer value and it will search about this value and see if it inside the linked list

* To String Method : return a values as "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
