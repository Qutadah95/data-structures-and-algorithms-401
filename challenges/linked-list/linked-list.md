kth function

Linked list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

index = ( 3 )

value = ( 1 )

# Challenge Summary CC8
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called zip lists
Arguments: 2 linked lists
Return: Linked List, zipped as noted below
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and
return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
