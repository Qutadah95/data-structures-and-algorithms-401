# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Trees are non-linear data structures. They are often used to represent hierarchical data. For a real-world example,
a hierarchical company structure uses a tree to organize.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

creat a node and binary tree and binary search tree

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
preOrder & inOrder & postOrder have O(n)
## API
